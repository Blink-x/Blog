        My earliest memory of computers is my parents buying a desktop when I was about 7. I would spend hours playing with and inserting all the discs, going through the menus and settings, staring at screensavers, and slowly uncovering images and websites on our dial-up connection. It was new, fascinating, and at many points incomprehensible to me.<br>
        ~<br>
        As I grew into a teenager, computers, in typical fashion, became a personal source of input and output. An outlet if you will. I escaped in the worlds of video games, designed html websites for my favorite subjects, got lost role-playing in chatrooms, would read endlessly about every subject that society was telling me was taboo or wrong.<br>
        ~<br>
        More than anything at that time, computers and the internet became my vessel of information and inspiration for anything else. Growing into adulthood led to computers becoming a methodical part of my life. I got my first laptop for college. I took half my classes online, and depended deeply on the internet and its wealth of information to help guide me through my subjects. The technology also remained an outlet where I could challenge myself, or relax and get lost, in any way I needed to.<br>
        ~<br>
        When I developed a career as an ICU nurse, I realized just how much computers meant to me on every level. They helped me decompress after long shifts, or stay connected to my friends who had moved far away. They were even the primary source of enjoyment for my job: I could access detailed information about my patients, display graphs and data to help me understand their disease processes, communicate more effectively with other members of the healthcare team, and document and transmit data in ways that were changing the landscape of the entire medical field.<br>
        ~<br>
        What I also realized was that I was unhappy with my career. Nursing wasn’t what I thought it was, and I found myself dwelling constantly on an exit plan. I went through every possible career trajectory, from looking up how to become an electrician, to actually going back to college for a year out of pocket to take medical school pre-reqs. Eventually, I started taking travel nurse contracts, which let me see and experience this beautiful country with more freedom. But still, I couldn’t find an answer. If nursing taught me anything, it was that money and careers are secondary to enabling yourself to be the most powerful version of who you are. It is only when you begin to do that, that you could more deeply understand what you would be happy doing.<br>
        ~<br>
        While in Redding, California on a travel ICU nurse contract during the COVID pandemic, my friend/in-law mentioned to me how he was picking up Python and looking at a career change that was programming/remote/digital nomad focused. I asked myself why, despite computers being such a huge part of my life, I never considered working <I>with</I> computers directly, instead of as a supplement to my job. It planted a seed in my brain.<br>
        ~<br>
        My partner and I took an travel assignment in Seattle toward the end of 2020/the COVID pandemic. At this point, I was beginning to find happiness in many other aspects of my life. I was in an area I truly loved, with nature and a vibrant city that filled me with joy. My personal relationships were strong, and I was financially stable. It was at this point that my mind had the ‘room’ to be curious and start exploring options the way I needed it to in order to find answers.<br>
        ~<br>
        I remembered my in-law Roy’s comment about learning Python and again asked myself why I had never even attempted learning a programming language for fun. So I searched the internet for a good starting point out of curiosity. I was surprised to find that most of the highest quality courses/programs were all free. I started with Harvard’s CS50 course lectures on a whim. I give huge credit to the lecturer, David Malan, for really unraveling the beauty of computers.<br>
        ~<br> 
        The way with which he personified computers and demonstrated how they <I>actually</I> work connected deeply with me, and turned a light bulb on in my head. It hit me: here I was, on a computer, getting a free education from one of the highest quality academic institutions in the world, <I>about</I> computers. The true magnitude and importance of computers in my life, and how much I could gain from them, began to make sense. And on top of it all, the exercises at the end of the lecture were fun, and challenged my mind in a way I wasn’t aware I needed.<br>
        ~<br>
        I continued to watch the CS50 lectures and work on their problem sets in C. I fell in love with problem solving. Thanks to working on a premium travel contract salary throughout the pandemic, I realized I had enough money to just quit my career as a nurse and devote 1-2 years to computers, and learning a new career. So I did. As of April 2021 I am jobless and pursuing a new career in web development with a remote/digital nomad lifestyle.<br>
        ~<br>
        This is my journey. Follow along if you will, as I post more about my path to becoming a web developer, life in general, photography from my adventures, and hiking/trail reports from my explorations.<br>
